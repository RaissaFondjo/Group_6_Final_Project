The suburb was quiet and there was a pond close-by. The train station is not too far but the train takes about 30 minutes to down town. We were located on the third floor of the family home and shared their entrance.  If you want your own space i''d suggest renting an apt in the area which we found out later cost the same. If you are working then this area is probably fine but for tourists would suggest some where more central like Back Bay or downtown. Kelly was pleasant and allowed us to make a local call which we appreciated. Unfortunately one incident at the end impacted our experience. We made a mistake with the check out time and thought it was 3pm. We were finalizing our packing when the cleaners came into the house. The host (Phil) came back shortly after and I was disappointed the way he spoke to my elderly parents in a very inappropriate and disrespectful manner. My dad was upset after the encounter . It was a genuine misunderstanding. We hadn''t discussed check out times with them (they were away the day before we were due to leave) and were unaware cleaners were due to arrive. At no time was this clarified by the hosts and as soon as we realised, we got out of their way and brought our luggage to the front door immediately. I privately emailed Phil on 27-9-2014 to convey my disappointment at his behaviour to try to resolve this in a cordial manner but never received a reply. (excerpt from email: I do want to express my disappointment at the way the matter was handled. My parents had not booked the bnb and were relying on us for all information. My father was upset after his exchange with Phil on Friday evening, which was rude and unwarranted against my elderly father who was taking all direction from us on the holiday.)The following day I received notification that he had left a review on this site. An apology would have sufficed. "

The home is a ~200 year old Victorian full of history and charm, and has the best views of the whole neighborhood - from the back windows on the second floor you can see the ocean. Very quiet area, but easy to get downtown to all the touristy stuff.  Little swingset for the kids in the back, too. Off-street parking was a real plus, and nearby restaurants (great Indian place around the corner) and CVS very helpful. Quick 10 minutes to the Savin Hill T line, but for our group of four, it was actually cheaper to take a 15-minute, $7.00 Uber to the downtown area. Sure beats driving and parking! The house itself was clean, clean, clean --and I am a clean freak so meeting my standards is no easy task. The place is also HUGE, and there is another rental up above in a separate condo (which was empty when we were there) so if you had a really large group you could rent the two separate parts of the home (each with own entrance) and probably fit 14 people! Beds were comfortable, and plenty of towels. The home is historic (except the modern kitchen and baths), so the floors are a little creaky and some of the plaster is showing its age, but that only added to the charm, in our opinion. Swank Properties folks jumped on all our questions and made check in and out a breeze. I''d stay with them again, here or at another property. Great service and communication!"

It was very clean and welcoming. The living room looks just like it does in the picture. It is very quiet. Chris did a great job of letting us know how  to get into her apartment and what we would find in the apartment (coffee and coffeemaker, for example).  She also gave us some great ideas for places to visit in the neighborhood. My friend who happened to be going to a restaurant she recommended and he said the review was spot on.  

The building dates back to 1899 so it can be startling when you enter. It has concrete floors in the entry halls and an old elevator with a door that slides open and a gate. It''s somewhat dark in the evening. Once you get past that, you will be rewarded with Chris'' place that has exposed brick and a comfortable feel appropriate to the neighborhood. She also has a well-stocked library and nice artwork for a homey feel.  

We stayed at the apartment during the longest days of the year.  That means it gets light very early in the morning in Boston (5 am). It was helpful for those days when I had to be up very early.  Not so great when I wanted to sleep in a little.  This will improve as the days get shorter and I suspect with some darker curtains or shades. 

If you like central air (which we didn''t need since we had perfect weather), then this is not the place for you (remember the building is over 100 years old). The  bedroom has a window air conditioner that really cools off the bedroom, which was all we needed. 

For storage space, there are two closets in the bedroom. I didn''t discover the largely empty closet behind the bedroom door until the third day. There was also some shelf space in the top shelves of the dresser and in the hanging shelves in the closet. I had a lot of clothes because I was attending a conference with different outfits during the day so it was a little short on space for me (plus I tend to pack on the heavy side) but not too bad.

The neighborhood is one of the best in Boston and is a good reason on its own to stay here.  I had to walk through the Public Garden and the beautiful Back Bay streets each day to get to my conference. (15 minutes to Copley Square.)  The streets are beautiful and historic. You are only blocks from the Statehouse and incredible architecture from the 1800''s. In the other direction you are a short walk to the Esplanade on the Charles River.  The Boston Commons is just across Charles Street from the Public Garden. And Charles Street offers excellent dining and shopping options (Tatte Bakery is great for morning coffee and pastries.) Cheers is close by on Beacon Street.  

I highly recommend Chris'' apartment. It''s delightful."

I was in town for a month for work and had my wife visiting so I wanted a place with more than a hotel could provide.

This apartment has an amazing view of the Golden Dome from the living room. The kitchen is small but adequate.  The bedroom is big and full of light.  The mattress and pillows are old and need replacing. The bathroom is big with minimal to no counter space and low water pressure but not terrible.  

I was in Boston in July. It was hot.  There is one widow AC in the living room which cools nicely but as the bedroom is down a long hallway it stayed a pretty warm temp. So, I asked for a fan to get some of the cool air from the AC down to the bedroom.  Anne provided one the next day. I like it cool/cold when I sleep and the fan was perfectly adequate to make me comfortable sleeping. I suggest getting a 2nd AC for the bedroom however the fan worked just fine.

Anne was extremely accommodating.  To the extent of not only getting a fan, but getting a new TV for me when I mentioned I travel with an AppleTV and the existing TV didn''t have an HDMI port.  I came home the next evening and she had replaced the TV with a newer one that had the necessary inputs!

The Building is beautiful with a doorman and rooftop deck over looking the Golden Dome and Commons in an amazing area.  Just beautiful. I had a great time.

As Kate says in her description, grocery shopping would be easier with a car. For us, without a car and with small children,  the station, shops and restaurants were a bit of a hike - especially uphill on the way back. 

The narrow and winding staircases - one up to the apartment itself (after the external steps to the porch ), and the set to the top floor, might be difficult for people with mobility issues and/or heavy luggage, but it is an older building with all the creaks and charm that go with it.

The apartment has basic window-mounted  airconditioning which maintained a comfortable temperature at night.

We expected toiletries to be supplied - not an unreasonable expectation - but the soap dispensers, shampoo and conditioner bottles were empty or so low as to not work when pumped. 

The neighbourhood is not the most salubrious but we never felt unsafe, and generally enjoy staying in localities with a bit of life.

The cats, Moth and Plum, were no trouble at all, and kept a low profile while we were there. There was a bit of a smell where the cats litter is kept, but that''s not a room we needed to use, so it was not a big deal.

A nice place overall, with a few minor issues"

The location was absolutely fabulous! It was very convenient for walking around the city, with easy access to the Green and Red lines and just steps away from the Esplanade and Public Garden. We were able to walk to a little grocery store on Charles Street as well as multiple coffee shops, restaurants and shops. I was traveling alone with my children and felt safe walking home from the T and through the neighborhood at night.

Our hosts were very gracious in meeting us upon our arrival and showing us around their home. The home itself was lovely with plenty of room on two floors. The shower was nice and the kitchen was fine for our needs (we did not cook full meals there, but did appreciate having a large fridge to store our breakfast items and dinner leftovers). The decor in the home is lovely and upscale but a bit formal (white upholstery everywhere!) so we didn''t spend much time lounging around (but that''s ok, we were mostly out exploring Boston!). 

The only negative feedback I have to offer is that the bed in the master bedroom was very, very firm. I really had trouble sleeping comfortably on it, which negatively impacted my stay (I woke up with a sore neck and back, feeling unrested). Obviously this is a matter of personal preference (I''m sure the hosts like their firm mattress!), but if you are not a fan of very firm mattresses then this is probably not the place for you.

Overall, this is a lovely home in a fabulous location and we had a great time!"

The only attention point for us was the overnight parking in the neighbourhood on weekdays but we succeeded with a little patience to park our car at the municipal parking on West Broadway.

When you first get there the apartment is clean and well furnished. You have access to wifi and an apple TV. Also the bathroom was well kept and stocked. 

I can’t emphasize enough the value you get for what you pay. The location is right in the heart of Boston and you have two T stops within a 5 minute radius. My group didn’t have to use an uber the whole weekend we were there. Also there’s a lot of food places right around the area, so you don’t have to make a trek anywhere to feed yourself or get supplies for the duration of your stay at the apartment.

Also, the apartment has a lot of space. Like I said, it fit 8 guys comfortably. All three beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean!

Seriously, this is the best find I’ve had on AirBnB. Could not have asked for a better place to crash in Boston.

The apartment is quite large which makes it feel more like a house than an apartment. The bedrooms are quite large and if you had a family of 4 or more staying, it would not feel crowded at all. Keep in mind there are a lot of stairs, but unless you''re going to be going up and down those stairs multiple times a day, it''s really not a big deal. We had no problem. The bathroom is nice and big and there is a washer and dryer in the unit just off of the bathroom which is great if you''re going to be staying a week or longer and want to do laundry. The view from the glass door in the kitchen is great. Sunrises were beautiful from that vantage point. It snowed one day while we were there and the view of all the snow covered homes and streets was so pretty. Logan airport is only about 6 miles away which is a big plus. We never walked to or from the house so I can''t tell you how the neighborhood is safety wise but it seemed nice enough. We were pretty close to everything and there''s the South End shopping center less than a mile away with a Target, Panera, Olive Garden and Applebee''s restaurant as well. We didn''t rent a car while we were there but used Uber and Lyft regularly. If you haven''t used Lyft before, their prices are better than Uber and if you''re a new customer, they will give you ten $5 off coupons to use on ten different rides which is great. We would definitely stay here again. "

There are stained glass windows in every room, including the kitchen and bath. The original hardwood floors have been refinished. The whole place was clean and tidy when we arrived, something which is of utmost importance to me. There are formal living and dining rooms, but we spent a lot of family time in the kitchen, which is well equipped for cooking and sharing a meal in between jaunts to the Boston city center -- a short ride on the Orange Line from the T stop close to the house. Louis is a master of detail; he even brought us fresh flowers from his beautiful garden every few days! Our departure from the house was bittersweet: bitter because we were leaving, sweet because of memories we''ll always cherish. Louis''s house will always be our home in Boston.

He also went above and beyond to help find some “toddler equipment” to lend to us for the kids (training potty, pack ‘n play, stroller, etc.).  I had asked if he happened to have a guard rail for the bed for my nervous toddler and when we arrived he had actually procured a separate toddler bed with guard rails!

Inside, the second floor home was clean and uncluttered.  There are beautiful, intricate, plaster crown moldings and hard wood floors.  The bed was comfy and the shower had plenty of hot water and water pressure.  Having a washer and dryer in the basement was of great benefit, as it allowed us to wash some clothes before going on to our next destination.
 
Remus is a friendly, well-behaved, considerate cat, and we enjoyed his company.  Larry is a gracious and caring host and the neighbors made us feel so welcomed!  The location, near Boston Common, is so central you may walk to many places about town, the MBTA and Starbucks.  There are several nice restaurants within blocks as well.

Totally fine for a couple to stay in but a third person would be pushing it. There was a little binder with suggestions of things to do in the area, as well as tons of closet space to store our things. The South End is a cool area with great restaurants and cafes nearby, and it''s fairly convenient to get to Cambridge or downtown via public transit.

One caveat about this place - although I was aware beforehand that Brent did not live in the apartment and it is operated by a larger rental company, it still felt odd to have more of a hotel experience than an airbnb experience. In the end, I would agree with a previous reviewer that I''m not sure it''s in the spirit of airbnb to have this rental property on the site. For instance, when I asked Brent about parking (is it okay to park on the street on Sundays, etc.), rather than outlining what the street parking rules are and giving suggestions about where to park for cheap in the area, he sold me a rental parking space behind the building. It worked out fine, but was a bit expensive ($25/night), and since he took a couple of hours to get back to me once we arrived, we had to pay to park in another parking lot for the night that his spot wasn''t available. My guess is that someone who lived in the apartment would be more in the know about street parking rules, and/or wouldn''t have charged an additional fee for the parking space. As well, the rental company sends you an email explaining that they expect you to run the dishwasher and strip the bed and things like that before you leave, which we would have done anyways, but has never been outlined to me when staying in other airbnbs. 

I guess it depends what type of experience you''re looking for. If you''re looking for more of a hotel experience, then this place is a good bet. And all in all, we had a good trip to Boston and enjoyed staying here."

We loved the beds which had great comforters and pillows for cooler nights . Our only contact with Fj was via texting but she was very quick in responding to any questions/concerns. Roslindale center is very close and has good places to eat/shop. We also discovered Jamaica Plain in our search for gluten/dairy free options for meals and there are a number of restaurants there that were accomodating. Lovely walks near Jamaica Pond and in the Arboretum.  Two delicious meals in Roslindale at Sophie's Grotto and Birch St. Bistro. We had a car and only used public transportation once to go into downtown Boston. Very easy. We really enjoyed being in a more relaxed neighborhood - people were very friendly and helpful.

Our hosts thought of everything and Sean was extremely responsive, communicative and accommodating.  They gave us information and instructions for everything and even a great restaurant recommendation that our whole group enjoyed.  Plus they left wine, coffee and chocolate for us -- really what more could you ask?  We found everything we needed in the kitchen and the rest of the home.

The rental is also right by the Old North Church, so if you were interested in doing the Freedom Trail Walk you are at a great starting point; start at the church and work your way south. We also loved that the rental was a 10 minute walk from the Aquarium T stop and allowed for us to get to and from the airport pretty easily.

This was my first Airbnb booked where we went through a rental company and not through the owner. The rental company was easy to deal with and the key pick-up went smoothly.

Having lived in several cities, I did not really stress about previous reviews regarding noise and suggestions for earplugs- I thought my fiance and I would be able to sleep through it all. If you are a light to moderate sleeper, you will definitely want to bring earplugs. We are pretty sound sleepers, but the walls are thin and you can hear everything going on outside and inside. 

Overall I would say that this is a great rental if you are planning to explore Boston on foot and are not too concerned with noise at night. The location is truly what makes this place worth it and I would definitely stay here again- with earplugs."

The building is old. The owner, Henry doesn''t live here. They takes care of garbage, and bleach the floors. However, cleanliness is the biggest problem. I don''t think they clean dusts in the corners. Inside the room, they do better job at cleaning, but kitchen and the bathroom aren''t that clean.

I would recommend this place for short term, since the price and the location is convenient. However, I wouldn''t recommend this place for long term. If they improve cleaning, then it might be okay for long term."

She doesn''t live at the apartment, though, so you won''t see her much.

The place itself is rented solely for AirBnB use. There are dead-bolt locks on each room''s door, so your stuff should be safe. I only saw the other people staying there once or twice in the entire week and a half I stayed. Everyone was reasonably quiet.

The room is what you''d expect at this price range. There was a desk, a bed and a closet with shelves for clothes. The Internet took a few minutes to get working, but after that, worked well.

The common areas were far less clean than the room itself. The bathroom had mold in the shower area and when I arrived, the place had an unpleasant smell. A cleaner comes by a few times a week, and the smell improved after being cleaned. But the common areas really need a deep clean and some remodeling. 

This is the first AirBnB I''ve stayed in that didn''t provide towels. Remember to bring your own or plan to buy one when you arrive. I bought two and left them there, so maybe they''ll still be there for future stays.

The location and the price are what makes this place. It is a few blocks from the JFK/UMass stop on the red line, making it quick to get into the city."

I stayed in the house for three months for a research visit and I really enjoyed my time."

As a former Boston resident, I knew the location would be great, but it proved to be even more convenient than expected. In addition to being walkable to Fenway, the Esplanade, & all of Back Bay/ South End, it was also just around the corner from the Arlington T stop and within a few blocks of several great cafes & bars. Despite the 4th of July crowds, we got lucky with metered street parking (free evenings, Sundays & holidays) on the opposite side of Commonwealth Ave Saturday through Monday morning. It also just happens to be in one of the loveliest parts of town.

The place itself is extremely clean & comfortable with great natural light. It has the kind of character and style that you can only find in old, converted city buildings decorated by people cooler than you are. We never met Scott, but he was warm & accomodating as a host through his various written correspondences. He made lots of extra provisions to ensure it felt extra-homey.

We only really had 2 criticisms, neither which Scott can be blamed for, but that should be kept in mind when choosing this place. First, entry to the front of the building is a little more than ''finicky''. It took a minute or two of patient, persistent key-jiggling to get the main door lock to yield... every time. It never really got any easier (especially after a long day and a few drinks). Hopefully, a re-made key might mitigate that struggle, but given the age of the building & its front door, a little bit of lock-picking wrist action may be inevitable. Secondly, the lofted platform on which the bed sits is a bit of a steep climb, especially on the way down. If you have any mobility limitations, middle-of-the-night clumsiness, or general uneasiness with ladder-stairs, this may not be the place for you. 

All that said, we would jump at the opportunity to stay here again. Thanks for everything, Scott!"

T (tram/subway train) nearby to get into Back Bay etc. The flat itself seemed run like a guesthouse: there''s a combination lock on the front door so you don''t need to arrange for keys (I never met the host who was out of town, but very nice and helpful) and the other 2 rooms are occupied by temporary guests as well. You''re at the back of a house, barred from the guest rooms by another combination lock. There are lots of clean towels in the hallway and a shared bathroom with a shower. I thought the place could have been cleaner: when I checked in my room''s floor was dirty, waste basket not empty; there''s some junk at the entrance. Shower, sink and bed were clean enough though. I was surprised to find out my room didn''t have a functioning lock on the inner door; host reassured me in that he screens guests, but I found it a bit unnerving nonetheless. I had a private outside entrance but the key I found in the room didn''t seem to work on either lock, so I would either have to leave it unlocked or not use it. Wifi works (more than one network available). Room had a fridge and a microwave. You won''t find a cheaper option in Boston, but expect it to be a bit rough around the edges. Also, consider that if you''re going to need to take a lot of cabs into Back Bay, Downtown or Cambridge, it may not be as convenient (I found it hard to find cabs there and almost missed a lecture I was giving because of it)."

Also, the kitchen was dirty, and both the floor and bed were dusty. The bathroom was a mess with random things made as decorations. The owner didn''t give us enough toilet papers to use so we had to use tissues and napkins. At night, it got so dark that we couldn''t be able to see so when we left the apartment in the afternoon, we had to leave the lights in the hallway on.

The space is just as it is featured on the listing. Everything is immaculate and I was beyond comfortable throughout my stay. The bed is great and I loved all of the natural light pouring into the entire space each morning. I was traveling alone so really appreciated the safety of the neighborhood and the security of the building. I didn''t rent a car and was easily able to access public transportation within just a few minutes'' walk. 

Favorite places for food and drink were the Navy Yard Bistro and the Warren Tavern, both of which were easy walks. The Bistro is very close. The Tavern was a bit of a longer walk but such a pleasant one and a great way to get a feel for Charlestown.  

Kristin''s communication leading up to my stay was spot on. She responded quickly every time. I loved that this continued during my stay. All of my questions (where are your dish towels?) received a speedy response. 

Finally, I appreciated the thoughtful touches that speak to her going the extra mile, like s cup of change for me to use for the bus and  a loaded laundry card. I didn''t do any laundry but those extra touches say a lot. 

I loved my experience and the location and wouldn''t hesitate to stay here again. In fact, I wouldn''t even bother looking elsewhere. "

He did give me a discount for giving me the wrong room, but it still was very uncomfortable and claustrophobic. 

I also got a call waking me up early from the owner because another guest thought they were supposed to be in my room. Again, this company really needs to get a grip on their booking practices.  

However, it was clean, and it is a great location.  Very bare bones and small.

I have been in many AirBnb houses or flats. Most of them look good, but furnished with stuff which quality is...just ok. However, this spot was amazingly tasteful. Pictures are good, but I think in real life it looks much better.

     Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience. We arrived at the apartment around 6PM, after a long day of traveling. The main problem was the extreme heat coming from the old style wall unit heaters in each of the rooms. There is no thermostat control in the apartment to regulate the heat. When we tried to plug in the air conditioning unit in the bedroom, the wall outlet started to spark because the cord was frayed. We had no choice but to open the windows and cool off the apartment. The building is on a very busy main street, so between the traffic and parties, it was pretty loud. 
     This is an old somewhat run down building. While it''s decorated very nicely, the pictures don''t represent the old condition of the apartment. Also, the TV didn''t work, the main room heating unit was leaking and there was significant dry rot on the floor, the bathroom sink hot water spigot didn''t work, and there was a lot of peeling paint. 
     We tried to contact Paige by email, phone, and text from 6-9PM, but there was no response. We finally heard back from her by text at 4:15am. 
      By this point we were exhausted, and decided we couldn''t stay for the second night. We texted Paige to tell her we were leaving before her 11AM checkout time. We walked a few doors down to the Eliot Hotel, and they were nice enough to let us check in early. 
     We asked for a $200 refund from Paige, but she said she never gives refunds for any reason. We submitted a resolution request through Airbnb, and because of our pictures and explanations, they agreed to refund the $200 since Paige would not. They also gave us $60 towards a future Airbnb booking. We have had great experiences with our last 2 Boston Airbnb rentals, and we will absolutely use Airbnb again. But I cannot recommend Paige or this apartment.

James obviously takes a lot of pride in his home, and it''s beautifully presented and immaculately clean. 
As this is a home, and not just an Airbnb rental, it was well equipped with everything we needed, and perfect for a family holiday.
It was a nice touch that there was milk and a few beers in the (URL HIDDEN) dad is now a massive Samuel Adams fan! ;)

We would definitely stay again, thank you for a great holiday!

Jill est simple, directe, positive, chaleureuse. Elle a son travail, ses engagements humanitaires, elle est très indépendante, mais elle reste à l''écoute et elle n''a jamais laissé passer une occasion de nous rendre service ou de nous renseigner tout en respectant notre autonomie. Nous étions à Boston afin de prendre des repères pour un roman;  après les heures de marche dans la ville, c''était un plaisir de retrouver cette maison tranquille, de prendre un verre sur la terrasse, de respirer sur la pelouse, de passer les nuits dans un calme campagnard. Le centre de Jamaïca Plain, à deux cent mètres,  est vivant et animé, il regorge de petits restaurants typiques et de commerces, on y trouve un fabuleux café-épicerie-restaurant bio, des fringues originales...  Le bus pour Boston passe à cent mètres, mais dix minutes de marche vous amènent au métro. Si vous aimez l''espace et la nature, un lac vous attend au bout de la rue, et le Franklin Arboretum, à cinq minutes de là, est extraordinaire. Autre point : le chat et les deux chiens sont bien vivants, les chiens sont drôles, toujours contents de vous voir, et assez obéissants. La maison et ses meubles sont patinés par le temps, mais les équipements fonctionnent vraiment correctement et l''ensemble est propre. en conclusion, nous recommandons chaudement ce bnb.

The house was perfectly comfortable and the neighbors were always incredibly friendly.
Also, if you are into cooking, this place had absolutely everything one might ever need for cooking. Seriously, one of the most complete kitchens I have ever seen! 
When we got there she had her signature flowers and a basketful of treats for us and the baby (even bubbles for him to play with!), and was incredibly supportive throughout our stay. At one point the microwave there died, and she helped us get a new one in no time. 
Overall we fell in love with her place and came to have it feel very much like home. When we visit Boston again we hope to go back to her haven!
Also, my son took his first steps in her apartment! We will love it forever because of this :).

Although we did not make extensive use of them, the additional amenities (TV, laundry, kitchen) were an added bonus.  Communicating with Jay, the owner, was very easy, and he accommodated any request we had during our stay.

The street on which the apartment is located does get a fair amount of vehicle traffic, as well as foot traffic, so just note that the day''s sights and sounds do start rather early.  Although there is street parking, as indicated in the listing, pay attention to signage - most spots on the street in front of the apartment have a two hour limit, and there is no overnight parking allowed on most days unless you are a resident with a permit.  For anyone that does plan on having a car, my recommendation would be to park at the garage at Boston Commons, and ride the T back to the station at Andrew.

Overall, this was a great experience, and I would consider staying here again (though probably without a car next time!)

From the time that I made the reservation, until the time that I checked out of the condo, Casey was extremely attentive and helpful with all aspects of our stay.  He was always available by phone, and was just a really nice person.  I was in Boston for a Trade Show at the Boston Convention Center, THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE IF YOU ARE ATTENDING ANY EVENTS AT THE CONVENTION CENTER! But, if you are coming to Boston for another reason, it is only a short cab ride to go anywhere else in the city.  We walked to a different place for dinner every night, as the neighborhood has a ton of fantastic walkable restaurants and cafe''s.  All within a five minute walk.  There is also a market just a few steps around the corner.  There is a spectacular rooftop recreation room, with a huge outside deck area to lounge with a glass of wine after a long day...which we made use of. There is also a postcard perfect view of the city skyline from the rooftop deck.  The one negative part of the experience for us was when it was time to go home (which is weird because we were in Boston for work!).  I would recommend this property to even the pickiest of travelers. I will be back for sure!  Thanks Casey!

At first, there was a problem with the internet router but Melissa worked hard to get it fixed, quite a feat considering it was about 10pm. Overall, though, we found that the place was quite dirty and very basic for the price, which was about $300 a night. We realize it was a busy week in Boston but this seemed like price gouging to us. There was only one old towel per person and the bedsheets were very thin. We wondered when the duvets had last been washed.... The kitchen was pretty clean (nice fridge) but was short on some basics, including a kettle. There is no coffee machine, only a Keurig that takes capsules and doesn''t make particularly good coffee. Also, it wouldn''t hurt to put up a few pictures or posters on the walls! Not a very cozy atmosphere, unfortunately!"

Diamond House is stunning, and the penthouse apartment was huge, spotless, and lovingly decorated. What with the incredibly comfortable bed, excellent water pressure in the shower, and massage chair, I felt like I was in a spa! 

I was visiting my BFF in the area, and we did not end up cooking beyond making a few salads. But I noticed that the kitchen was fully equipped with every type of utensil and gadget one could need. The full-size fridge and stove were superb, and the kitchen had a cafe style table and chairs that we loved sitting at. The ceiling fan in the kitchen was much appreciated during my summer visit!

I was also grateful for excellent air conditioning, because it was in the high 80s and humid in Boston the week I was there! Coming back to Diamond House after a day out and about was a true pleasure. Louis has done an amazing job with both the interior and exterior of this gem of a mansion. The gardens are a vivid addition to the beautiful paint and stained glass windows. 

As for the neighborhood, it was perfect for my needs. I went a few blocks down every morning for my latte splurge to Ula Cafe, and I also went for tacos down the street right when I arrived--delicious! I went running at Jamaica Pond several times, which was a short walk from Diamond House--as was central Jamaica Plain, chock full of cafes, restaurants, ice cream, etc. 

I did not rent a car, and was so happy to be around the corner from the T--it was a straight shot into downtown Boston for activities. Coming from San Francisco, where the public transportation is terrible, I was delighted with the speed of the T. I even took it to the airport upon my departure since I wasn''t in a hurry--it was fast and easy.

Staying in Jamaica Plain was the right choice for me, since I wanted access to the Arboretum and a place to run on non-paved paths--and I was able to get into the city proper quickly. 

Louis was a wonderful host and had I took all of his suggestions. Anyone would be lucky to have him as their concierge for a fantastic stay in the Boston area!

Parking was a nightmare, but that''s not Mac''s fault. My car was towed despite reading all the signs carefully and being quite certain I was in a visitors spot on a non-street cleaning street. Alas, apparently all streets get cleaned they just don''t all have signs saying so. "

After one night I left to stay in a hotel because  I needed to get some sleep and I didn''t know if there would be another night like the first.  Arthur''s response to this was less than considerate to the point of being curt.  He refused to refund the one night that I did not stay there.  Now as to the accommodations: sketchy at best.  Limited privacy, college dorm room aesthetic, 3 flights up of very tight stairs with no elevator, bathroom overflowing with male toiletries of every description, and worse of all, every sound made throughout the apartment was clearly heard in the room. Really bad.  A woman would definitely not feel comfortable here.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  There are plenty of other airbnb locations that are much better and much less expensive."

Mike responded to my messages almost immediately and offered a lot of helpful advice and recommendations.

The apartment matched the description and pictures exactly!  Plenty of linens and towels were provided and Chris showed us where extras were if we needed them!  The neighborhood was beautiful and close to public transportation as well as places to eat, drink and grab a cup of coffee. 

Small nit-picky details that kept me from rating it 5 stars - the bathroom floor needed a good sweeping/mopping and the AC unit barely kept up. Probably needs to be a bigger more powerful unit.  It was only an issue during the day since it was cool enough at night to open the windows. It would also be nice if there were extra pillows in the closet for freaks like me who like a ton!  ;-)

It was clean and it had towels, toiletries, hairdryer, iron, etc.. what you could expect from a hotel room. The space was perfect, and the bonus terrace was great. It was nice having a washer & dryer even with soap to use, only minor down side was dryer took several (like 3) cycles to dry small set of clothes. We also had an issue with a/c on one side of apt. We suffered some heat in morning trying to get ready, however the issue was fixed the same day when we were back by evening. The one major issue that bothered us the most was the LOUD noise from construction crew that started at 6am everymorning during our 3 night stay. It sounded so loud it seemed like they were inside the apt. So uncomfortable that even once awake it was annoying. We didn''t appreciate having to wake up so early during our vacation this way. I communicated by text/email with Josh and he apologized, and said he would refund us if we decided to move. This was not a convenient option for us, since taking the time to find a hotel and move in the middle of our trip was not something we wanted to do. I tried calling Josh but number used for text didn''t go thru. You really don''t get to meet or talk to Josh. Only communication is by text or email. After speaking to others who live at same building we realized construction has been going on for a while. I am pretty sure we are not the first ones with this issue. It was unfortunate that the construction issue prevented our stay from being exceptional."

She offered to drive us to a brunch spot not too far away, and gave us a bunch of suggestions for things to do in Boston, as well as offering us her cereal for breakfast. She also let us come by as soon as I requested to book, and let us leave at night rather than her said check out time to accommodate us due to our delayed bus home. Her and her husband''s home was clean, along with their bathroom that had great shower pressure. The only downfall out of two was the neighborhood wasn''t too great, so we couldn''t hang out around the house much. But the bus was just a minute was away that took us to the train station, and Natalie made sure we knew where we were going. Also, our bed was uncomfortable (it was an air mattress); there was another empty Airbnb room next to ours with a regular bed, and I wondered why we weren''t offered the more comfortable room. Overall, I do recommend if you don''t mind having to jump on transportation, and you''re just looking for a place to bunker down after a long day of adventuring :) thank you Natalie!!!"

(We were also surprised that none of this information came out in other reviews and somehow we paid $200 a night for this experience.)

The apartment was in a great location, but that’s about all it has going for it. It took only a few minutes before we realized how dirty it was. The carpet has taken on a light dirt color and the bathroom and kitchen linoleum was very sticky and gross. The paint in the bathroom has bubbled out and is starting to fall off (no fan for the shower). In the bathtub we were greeted by an alive cockroach stuck on its back waving its antennae in distress. My boyfriend looked for something to end its misery and found a dust pan in the closet. We quickly realized the “maid service” hadn’t used the dust pan anytime recently; when he picked it up there was a dead and dried-out cockroach underneath!

We decided to leave and drown our sorrows in Italian food and wine. If you make the mistake of staying here and want to do the same, the place is called Grotto and is amazing!

When we came back we were greeted by what seemed to be the heat of a thousand suns, but was just the radiator. We looked for a thermostat only to realize there wasn''t one. There’s only one temperature, “hot and sweaty” and the only way to adjust it is to open the door and let the cold air come in. The cockroach battle was futile, we learned the next morning that they enter through the drain in the bathtub/shower. This could be fixed by installing a 50 cent drain cover, but unfortunately it doesn’t seem like a priority.

The last thing I’ll note is the noise. There are some pipes which kick on and off every ten minutes and make an annoying pumping sound while clanking against the wall and TV stand. The fridge is old and loud, its compressor kicks on every 20 minutes or so. You’ll hear every time the upstairs neighbor takes a step. There’s also a loud dripping sound that comes from above as well, it lasts for about 5 minutes at a time and repeats in 30 minute intervals. The final noise to note is a really random one that we heard a few times during night, it sounds like ceiling is going to collapse and end your misery. If you want to sleep, make sure to bring ear plugs!"

It was better than i expected. So many AirBnB apartments are SPARSE. You get two unmatched plates, 2 sets of cutlery, and an odd glass or two.

NO - Edana provides a real apartment with everything you could want. Fully furnished. A wonderful kitchen with pots, pans, cutlery, knives, even lots of spices and oils

I am absolutely staying here again.

This is not a tourist area. When you stay at Edana''s you are in REAL Boston. Not something designed for the tourist. The neighborhood is a wonderful mixed area with gorgeous Boston houses & 3-deckers from the 1870''s and after.  This is the real thing.

The neighborhood has neighborhood restaurants - and yes, a WholeFoods within a mile.

You are a block from the Orange Line that takes you to all the Boston tourist activities in 20 minutes.

A gem. Now I''m afraid by posting this review I''ll never be able to stay here again!

Pros:
Renting from Boston Furnished Rentals was really easy and seamless!  The communication with Jan was great: she was very responsive, with lots of details and information, and very fair. Very patient as I worked through my travel schedule after another host canceled, which I really appreciated. Key pickup and dropoff was simple. The keys were ready for me when I got to the pickup spot (a local realtor) and the apartment was ready when I got my keys, no issues whatsoever.
The neighborhood is wonderful: safe, vibrant, and full of great restaurants and lots of history. Everyone is super-friendly, too. Very close walk to the Haymarket station (about ten minutes) to get on the T and explore, and fabulous culture right outside your door. GREAT location.
All linens (sheets, towels, etc) were fresh and clean, and the apartment itself had been wiped clean. Some simple toiletries (shampoo, hotel soap bars) were available. Kitchen is well stocked in terms of plates, cups, cutlery etc. with soap and sponge at the sink, has a small selection of pots and pans, coffee maker; basic essentials. Some pantry items like teas and vinegars, some spices, also in the cabinet. Fridge was clean and empty and ice trays were full on arrival. 
Cons:
The building and the apartment itself could both really use some TLC - everything could use a deep-clean and a fresh coat of paint. The bathroom is in need of renovation, plus really tiny: a very narrow stall shower and a low sink (no pictures in the listing) but was clean on arrival. The apartment door opens right into the bedroom, and this is not exactly a proper one bedroom as the listing states, but feels much more like a large studio with the open floor plan. The apartment is at ground level, and during most summer weekends in the North End, there is a carnival right outside the window that runs all day through until midnight. If you''re looking for peace and quiet, buyer beware: Be sure you understand the summer feast schedule so you know what the noise implications are. Once the event wraps up, this neighborhood is truly tranquil, but during the festival it is bustling. If you''re looking to open the windows to smell the delicious carnival foods and people-watch from home, you''re in for a real treat! Plus, you don''t have to go further than your door to get to the fun, and these events are really a blast.
Overall, the process was so simple as were my needs for this trip. I enjoyed my stay, and though I feel it''s worth noting that the place could use a bit of refurbishing, it didn''t impact my personal comfort level. If I had the same needs in the future, I would rent again. "

Her place is in a convenient location to the airport which made for a cheap Uber ride (less than $10). It is very walkable to a lot of restaurants and mini mart stores. We ate at this amazing Irish Pub on Bennington Street; Kelley Square Pub. It was very Cheers like, everyone was friendly. We went to the park across the street one night and walked to the lookout over the Harbor, which was a nice walk and super close if you just wanna get out of the house. We didnt use the TV at all, the living room was hot! There is no central A/C. It didnt bother us much for sleeping, as the rooms had window units, but it didnt cool the rest of the house much. If this place had central AC and perhaps a TV in the bedrooms that would be a huge bonus, but we were out and about so it wasnt a big deal. The house is super close to the train station and it costs $12 for an all day pass to get around...that was nice and made it super easy to get around.

We were attending a conference at the Boston Convention Center.  This Airbnb is in a great neighborhood and only a 15 minute walk to the convention center.  There was another woman with me and both of us felt very safe walking back at night alone.  Met some great dogs (and their owners) taking night time walks.  There is parking at the condo so we never took the car out, either choosing to walk or taxi to restaurants.  

The condo itself was so comfortable and homey.  It was nice to leave the convention center and go to a restful welcoming place and not a sterile hotel room.  Kitchen is outstanding and fully stocked.  I wish I had had time to cook.  The place is clean and updated with good bathrooms.

I highly recommend this Airbnb if you are traveling to Boston.  It can easily fit 5-6 people and would be great for a family.  Put this choice high on your list.

The only negative comment I have is there were no grab bars in the shower.  After all, the conference I attended included osteoporosis and the risk for falls!!  For most people doing Airbnb this is not an issue but for those who have a risk for falling, showers are roomy and safe but lacking bars to help balance."

Although he was not there, we were always able to easily get in touch with him prior to booking and throughout our stay. The house was clean and neat when we arrived. It was so great to come home each evening and relax. Furnishings are not just tastefully picked out and beautiful arranged, every piece is super comfortable. The beds were heavenly. Foam mattress, down blankets and soft sheets, were absolutely magical to fall into after a long day. The kitchen is fresh and modern, filled with great appliances and nicely stocked and we had everything we needed. We stayed hung out at home a few nights, just cooked dinner and chilled on the deck. Small local market and a grocery store are just minutes away. The neighborhood itself is authentic Southie. It has come a long way over the years and turned into a hip, safe area, filled with young professionals and families. Tons of awesome restaurants just a short walk from the house so if you are a foodie or just enjoy a good meal, that is definitely the area to be. All and all our stay was a 5-star experience! I have to say its homes like this and hosts like David that what keeps me coming back to Airbnb. Thank you!

Her decor is just stunning. We spent mornings over coffee planning our day and evenings over wine reliving our adventures in the gorgeous dining room. Our beds were soooo comfy (important in our family) and the bathroom situation for six people was better than convenient. There was plenty of space in the kitchen for everyone to make their own coffee and get whatever they wanted for breakfast. Katy was a gracious hostess. I made a special request and she honored it prior to our arrival. We walked most places. The location of the brownstone is quite good.  Comfort and charm are here! Don't miss it!

On the pro side, the house is beautiful and location is great. 

On the con side, one of the beds was broken and unusable, and the host did not notify us before arriving. 

When we called about it upon arrival, the host told us to blow up an air mattress if we wanted privacy in a room. We didn''t want to ask one of our guests to sleep on an air mattress on the floor so he had to sleep in a common area rather than a private room. 

These things happen, but it''s unacceptable when you''re booking for almost a week and the host does not offer the courtesy of a warning when a bed is not usable. 

The host did followup later and ask how he could make the stay more enjoyable but without a fix for the broken bed it wasn''t what we were expecting. "

The location of the condo is just around the corner from Newbury Street and Boylston Street, the Hynes Convention Center Subway stop, and so many shops and restaurants I look forward to trying on subsequent visits.

We''re a family of 4 with two teen daughters. The house is huge! We took over the dining room to open all our suitcases for easy access. One consideration for some might be the stairs. There''s a flight from the street/driveway parking to the front door. Then another to the second floor bedrooms & family room, and another to the third floor bedroom and bathroom. Although there are 3 full bathrooms in the house the shower in the 2nd floor bath is being renovated. The remaining 2 were fine for us but if you must have 3, ask M if the renovation is finished. The 3rd floor bedroom had no air con and was too hot for sleeping (we visited in July). But the sofa in the aircondioned family room was comfy for our younger daughter. 
The immediate neighborhood is not the greatest for food, shops, services, etc. But Boston is a compact city and we navigated to a variety of great spots with the help of our constant companions: (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps.

First, I''d like to state that Jean did me a kindness by letting me stay last minute and for allowing my cat to stay there. I had an unfortunate situation with a sublease and needed a place to stay for a month. However, that being said, once conflicts arose, it was clear that Jean was in denial about the state of the place and did not take the appropriate measures to correct it. Jean has not actually been in her property for several months and has not seen the state of it. Instead, she has the two college-aged tenants there to take care of things even though they did not agree to it.

Problem 1: The minute I got there, the room smelled like body odor and nothing was clean. There was short, brown curly hair on the floor with dirt and dust. The sheets also had the same stuff on them. I was told that someone was supposed to have cleaned but apparently didn''t. I suppose an unfortunate situation. I overlooked this and cleaned on my own.

Problem 2: I was notified by the roommates that there is a mice problem. Two mice to be exact. I found mouse droppings in my room (which does not look like the picture, btw). When I contacted Jean, she just suggested putting peanut butter in mouse traps... no shock or apology that it was even an issue.

Problem 3: There are no nice views at this place. In fact, the only appeal to this place is its proximity to the T station. However, be warned that if  you are a girl travelling alone, you should not go outside at night. This area ((SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) it) is known for gunshots and stabbings. I heard several the two weeks I was there. Jean denied this (again, not even being in the same state) and said I must have heard fireworks. I grew up in Texas and own several guns. I know what a gunshot is and this was corroborated by the roommates. Be careful if you choose to stay here.

Problem 4: The listing is advertised as having a washer and dryer. It is actually the worst false advertisement I have encountered. They are located in the basement of the property surrounded by dirt, filth, and general muck. It''s clear the washer hose has some sort of leak so where you put your laundry in, you''re standing in this gross muddy, dirt puddle. It is not sanitary or healthy in any way and she shouldn''t even advertise a washer and dryer at this place.

Look--- if you absolutely want to stay here then ok. The roommates were great. However, it is not worth the amount that''s charged and you can find much better in the city in a much safer area. And if you have conflict, don''t expect Jean to deal with it at all."

The greatest advantage of Vincent''s home was its location and reasonable price. Compared to the outrageous and over-priced Airbnb properties in Boston, Vincent''s rate was fairly reasonable. 

His home is located in Beacon Hills, and it is a beautiful neighborhood. The buildings are over 100 years old, but his place was renovated, and there were no problems with the amenities (water/heating/air-condition). It only takes 1 stop to MIT, and 4 stops to Harvard, and it is near almost everywhere (including tourist attractions). 

Air conditioners were provided for the hot summer days, and Vincent was kind to provide weekly professional cleaning on Saturdays. We were very busy, so to have someone clean the house each week was incredibly helpful.

I truly enjoyed my daily trips across the Charles river, and the breath-taking sunsets on Beacon Hills. I want to thank Vincent for his hospitality through prompt replies to my questions and requests, and I hope to have the chance to reside again in the near future.

Emily was a great host:  very communicative in advance and left a nice packet of suggestions we definitely used.  There was also a fun bowl of candy for guests my daughters appreciated!  She was out of the country while we were there, but the friend she arranged to meet us was quite helpful.

The wifi was excellent. I did have issue with the lock as there were no real explanation of the locking mechanism and so called Flatbook. Their representative came out and showed me how it worked but even he had issues getting lock to work correctly. Later that evening we ran into difficulties and needed assistance and none was available. Clients make sure your code is working correctly. Once it was changed the following morning, no further issues. The location is excellent as we were going to shows at Fenway so easy to take Harvard Ave Green T stop (1 block away) and head to Fenway or anywhere downtown in Boston. There are multiple restaurants and grocery stores in close proximity. The beds are comfortable. All three bedrooms are similar in size so that is excellent. Kitchen is updated and even though we did not cook, it was well-stocked. Flat panel TV with satellite programming was excellent as we caught some of the Olympics. As Flatbook has several units in the building, you do hear your neighbors if they come home late and decide to continue the evening in their apartment as the walls are thin but this was not much of an issue as we had no small children with us.  Due to the price of hotels in Boston area, this is an excellent alternative to a hotel for a group coming into Boston for sightseeing, sporting events or music. It is also in close proximity to Boston University so could be alternative for visiting students in the area. I am not sure I would recommend for families traveling with small children but overall, I would recommend. Also there is a great restaurant near by on Brighton Avenue called Carlo''s Cantina with fantastic Italian food. "

She had a beautiful apartment. It was more spacious than the pictures give justice to. She also provided us with towels and amenities. She knew we were on our girl’s trip and even provided us with make-up wipes, which was a nice and thoughtful gesture. 
We enjoyed our stay at Christina’s apartment and had no issues. The apartment has its own entrance. It was also in a great location – Beacon Hill. We felt very safe walking around, even at midnight with no one on the streets! The neighborhood is very charming and easy to get around. I highly recommend staying here.

However the apartment was disappointing as I was expecting something quite different. This was due to the fact that I had relied on the positive reviews which in fact related to another premises owned by the hosts. This may have been due to an anomaly in the Airbnb system. The apartment is well located but is still a work in progress project. With some work it could be nice but before booking I would recommend prospective tenants should ask for confirmation that renovations are complete. On a positive note the hosts were accepting of my criticism and have been in contact with Airbnb themselves to have the system for multiple reviews amended.

John was a most gracious host, responsive to my inquiries and accommodating when my arrival flight was delayed.  He provided thorough details of how to get around on public transportation (Silver and Orange Lines are within blocks), although I discovered most everywhere I wanted to go was perfectly walkable.  The house is a quintessential “Boston” Brownstone Row-house (though John describes it more accurately) surrounded by the SoWa art district, intimate neighborhood restaurants, and parks.
I really wouldn’t change a thing.  I probably got spoiled a little since I was John’s first Airbnb guest, but he was a friendly, helpful and genuine host and I wish him much success in his Airbnb endeavors. 

Highly recommended."

I was looking for a place where I could be a hermit without feeling any obligations to interact with anyone, and just get my work done - and that''s exactly what I got!

I arrived by bus on a Saturday evening, hopped on the Silver line (which stops just a block away), picked up my keys from a neighbor, and dropped off my bag before heading to a fantastic Senegalese place for dinner just a few blocks away.

The next day I wrote in peaceful solitude in the sunny living/dining room space before a refreshing ~40 minute afternoon walk to the convention center. The following day I packed up and left the keys on the counter per the instructions of Ibrahim''s friend, Michael, who was always available by phone for questions while Ibrahim was out of town.

The apartment is located in a wonderful part of the neighborhood, near restaurants, stores, and transportation.  I especially loved the African and Diaspora art throughout the house. The kitchen is very modern although I didn''t get a chance to use it; everything was clean and essentials laid out. All in all, I really couldn''t ask for a better stay and I hope to return with less work to do!"

Lots of beautiful old homes. This one has been renovated extensively into 3 sections. We did not feel comfortable dining in the immediate area so a car is a must. The only grocery was hard to find. The house has off street parking which was an asset. Don''t stay here if you are planning to take a bus or subway to get around.
Overall this house is wonderful for a large group such as ours, but know you have to climb stairs to the bedrooms which are on the 1st and 3rd floors. One real plus are the amenities that are provided. There are a ton of towels, soap, kitchen supplies, paper supplies, even shampoo. It was nice to have all that there upon arrival. The only thing missing in the kitchen was a spatula (hint) for flipping eggs. The a/c is spotty. Really cold on first floor, comfortable on 2nd floor and much warmer on 3rd floor. We assigned sleeping rooms based on temp. Aihua was supposed to bring portable fans for the upstairs but never did. Those of us in the upstairs bedrooms were not as bothered by the heat as others so we worked it out. However, if you are hot natured it might not be to your liking. Overall we enjoyed our  trip to Boston, and our stay in this property. We sightsee all day so only use our house after dinner at night to after breakfast in the morning and it was just fine."

This was my first AirBnB experience. As a new user, I was unaware that bookings might not include amenities such as use of the kitchen. I understand now that this is a common occurrence.

I saw later, after arriving and discussing with Helena, that indeed the use of the kitchen was not included in the amenities. This was an oversight on my part.

However, I personally believe that it should have been and could have been made clearer in the written description for the booking. It was not apparent to me that I could not cook in the house and I would not have stayed if I knew that. Something along the lines of No use of the stove, yet you can use the microwave to heat food up would have been helpful. What did not make much sense to me was that I could use the microwave to cook eggs, which took longer and made more noise than making them all at once on a frying pan, but I could not use the stove even if I cleaned up after myself.

Even though this listing is marked as a private room, it is a shared residence with many other tenants. It seemed like I needed to tip-toe around the house as not to disturb anyone. The description in the listing says you need to be very quiet, and this became very apparent right from my arrival. It made me a little uncomfortable when accompanied with not being able to use the kitchen, because I felt as though all the tenants did not want me there. I do not feel like that is an appropriate environment for a stranger to be in, to be honest.

I also experienced an odd situation during my stay. I entered the kitchen at 6:30AM one day and there were four dead mice on the kitchen floor. I later thought it may have been the cat bringing them in, but at the time I became even more uncomfortable.

On the other hand, I did greatly enjoy the proximity to the Charles River (specifically since I was staying for the Head of the Charles rowing regatta, the Northeastern University Boathouse). The cost was relatively expensive (as a student), but I suppose reasonable when compared to hotels in the area on such short notice.

However, there are different shift during a day, and very soon I found that most of the reception assistant there were quite nice and helpful.

For the place itself, this is te best one among all the apartments I stayed in Bangkok and China. However, one is better to make sure the move-in instruction is received well before the trip is started, and confirm the check-in, check-out time."

It has been such a great experience that I feel like I really need to write something nice and special for our consistently nice host, and now our good friend, but find it hard to put all the good things down in a few words. 

As new comers in the town, the first weeks seemed especially challenging as we had a lot of details to go through, documents, grocery, preschool, etc. Whenever we had a problem/question, she was always there with practical, informative advice, and had often gone extra miles to help. She introduced us to her friends, invited us to join gardening in her mini-farm, which my 3.5-year-old daughter enjoyed so much, and even let me borrow her bike since I didn''t have a car yet. We had nice talks, on where to go, what to buy, how to eat healthy(btw she makes great granola! ), and we even joined her family one day in camping and canoeing!  just too many to list... In a word, this has turned out to be a great family exchange experience instead of a simple bnb stay, and so have we become good friends with her family, including her two lovely sons and Canyon the adorable, hardly-barking dog! 

The only pity is, she''s got a nice garden out there, with apple and cherry trees, tulips and strawberries, and a lot of vegetables, but because of the season we couldn''t see much before we left, though we did dig out some parsnips and made soups...

The room itself is quite a cozy place, private bath, private entrance, spacious room, shared kitchen. 20 minutes walk to forest hill station, 5-10 mins walk to Bus 32 on Hyde Park Avenue and then 10 minutes to the  forest hill station.

Negativ bewerten muss ich die Unmöglichkeit der Internet-Nutzung, das WLAN-Signal war einfach zu schwach. Ebenso ein Minus war die Verfügbarkeit von Warmwasser beim Duschen, zwei Personen konnten warm duschen, dann war die Kapazität der Warmwasserboiler bereits erschöpft.

Positiv ist jedoch alles andere, das Boot ist gemütlich, sehr sauber, gut ausgestattet von zusätzlichen Bettdecken bis zur Küchenausstattung. Die Heizmöglichkeiten funktionieren sehr gut. Die Lage ist perfekt für Stadterkundungen, alles ist gut zu Fuß erreichbar. Es ist ruhig, wir haben alle gut geschlafen, an das leichte Schaukeln eines Bootes, was sich nun ja nicht ganz vermeiden lässt, gewöhnt man sich schnell, auch Leute die leicht seekrank werden, kommen damit gut zurecht. Für 6 Personen ist der Platz absolut ausreichend, die beiden Schlafkojen sind ein wenig kurz, Menschen über 1,60 m könnten damit ein Problem haben.

Ich würde das White Elephnat jederzeit wieder buchen. Die Terrasse mit der Möglichkeit zum Grillen muss im Sommer traumhaft sein."

Mike war im Vorfeld sehr hilfsbereit und hat uns die Anreise und auch die Ankunft sehr leicht gemacht. Das Zimmer ist zwar relativ klein für 2 Personen mit 4 Gepäckstücken, aber für eine Nacht war es total ausreichend. Auch das Twinbett war für 2 Erwachsene sehr schmal, aber gemütlich.

We booked a different apartment, but were informed the day before move in that the original apartment had a plumbing problem so we were moved into this one. But that was only after I called to ask why we didn''t have move in instructions yet (I''d sent 3 emails asking where the move in instructions were with no reply).  

This apartment had had a long term renter in it that moved out the day before we arrived.  Seamless'' cleaning crew worked on it all day and when we arrived it appeared clean on the surface, so we moved in.  Once we were in though we started to see just how dirty it was.  Filthy.  Old food stuck in the kitchen, food stuck in the kitchen sink, sticky spots on the floor, dirty furniture, dirty carpet.  On top of being dirty there was a burned out light bulb in the bathroom, one of the bathroom sinks didn''t drain, one of the window blinds fell off when we opened it, the carbon monoxide detector chirped constantly, the elevator was broken (making a loud noise) keeping us up at night (they fixed that on day 3 of our stay). We wanted to move, but it was such a pain we decided to live with it.

I emailed Seamless 3 times while we were in the apartment about the filth and the issues with the apartment and never received a reply.  That''s 6 total emails to them without a reply.  I would never rent from them again.

This upset us, frightened the other family, and made our long day even longer. 
Thankfully, the front desk clerk had master keys to the other units and said he would try to find us a room. Room #2 we walked in had yet another family and finally room #3 was empty and did have paper work with my name on it. 
We called the 24/7 emergency line and no one answered. Eventually we got a hold of someone at Churchill and after expressing my concern that we didn''t feel safe (who knows how many keys are floating around??) all they did was apologize and say that never happens. An apology didn''t make me feel any safer! 
That night was extremely hot so we were forced to sleep with the windows open as the AC wasn''t working. Ever stayed near Fenway on a weekend? It''s noisy and made it hard for us to sleep.
The next day I called again to complain about the AC and after Churchill called the building they informed us the AC won''t be turned on until May 1st. 
The listing for the rental says our apartment offers individually controlled AC/Heat... a little false adverstising?

This is just the hardest things we dealt with and I could go on, but will stop by saying that we talked to customer service and once again was just apologized to so I asked to speak to a manager. 

It has been FOUR days since I was told a manager would call me. 

Do NOT rent from this company if you care about customer service. I worked in customer service for over 8 years and I understand that mistakes happen, but also know that when problems arise the company needs to not just offer a simple apology and expect things to be swept under the rug. 

(I also have picture of the HUGE stain on the carpet, gross stain on kitchen floor, weird disgusting food running down kitchen cabinets, and dirty bathroom floor.) "

She provided me with some shampoo and body wash as well as clean towel. My stay was perfect. It felt like home, nothing to complain about. Even though during my stay the toilet pipe clogged but hey it happens in every house and Monica got it fixed right away so I''m happy with everything.

Easy access to pick up the key and the location is awesome if you want to be in the heart of little Italy in Boston.  Paul Revere''s house I believe in just a few blocks from the place.

Be careful in the morning when the lights are out as there small ledges where you could slip.  "

Tom''s was very responsive and helpful during our stay. 
Unfortunately our stay has been ruined by the terrific conditions of the apartment which was not clean at all and not very functional. The kitchen and the refrigerator were particularly obscene (and we just couldn''t use them), the towels in the bathroom were dirty and still wet, there was a huge quantity of sand hidden under the carpet, the trash was full, we found hairs on the linens and there was no space four our belongings (Tom lives there and the apartment is full of his own belongings). 
For our trips we are used to stay in airbnb apartments (our own is on airbnb during the summer period) and never find one in these conditions. 
We immediately informed Tom who apologized several times and paid back the cleaning cost (it seemed that the cleaning service didn''t clean the apartment before our arrival)
It''s a real displeasure for me writing such a review because I think that Tom is a great person but his apartment''s conditions really ruined our stay. 
Nevertheless, if clean and with some free space for the guests'' belongings, I definitely recommend his apartment."

The location was perfect within walking distance to Newbury & Boylston Street and the subway.

Check-in and the directions provided were excellent!  And the concierge Michael was very helpful.

The apt seemed to be fairly new and very clean, however, there were a few disappoints but an easy fix: (1) the condo smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.  Even though we opened up the windows during the time we were in the apt it did not eliminate the smell (2) there were no hair dryers (we packed lightly and none of us thought to bring a hair dryer as every apt I''ve rented also provided this (3) there was no soap for the dishwasher which we expected with 4 people utilizing the space (we did not realize this until the last day when we were leaving and planned to put the dishwasher on) (4) the windows in the 2nd bedroom would not open.  We called maintenance, but did not have anyone come by during our stay.

Overall I would recommend this apt especially if the little things above were fixed.

The air conditioning in combination with the fans kept the flat nice and cool, as we were visiting in a particularly hot/moist time of the year. 
transit was a quick hop and a skip away and got us downtown in about 30 mins. Groceries were nearby along with great coffee and places to eat. 
There was always street parking available during our stay, which was a big plus for us as we were lugging around a minivan

The neighborhood is safe, clean, friendly, and convenient as well. We could hop on a train at multiple close locations or cab it easily. We walked quite a bit too. Whole foods is right down the street plus many other stores & restaurants. BU campus close by which gave the neighborhood a nicely diverse & hip vibe since it borders more traditional Brookline.
Now if that wasn''t enough, your hosts bend over backwards for you and do it very matter of fact, with genuine smiles and sincere kindness.
Danielle who is a young, energetic, tiny young lady helped  me unload our stuff into her quaint but small elevator for two runs as she sprinted up 6 flights of stairs!! Then she guided us to a safe street parking space that she saved for us, that allowed us to keep parked our entire stay from Thurs to Tues (today).
After that she immediately responded to questions I texted her shortly after she left us in the place.
Anyway I could go on forever but it''s tough typing all this on a tiny phone, lol. Hope there aren''t too many typos? ;-)
Thank you both for such a wonderful and affordable  experience!! Who needs hotels anymore?

Her home is conveniently located in a lovely neighborhood, with all of the amenities you would need within 15-20 minutes walking distance or a 5 minute Uber ride. 

Her instructions for getting into the home, and for caring for it were clear and detailed, and we were able to enter and leave the rental without issue. 

The top floor of Christina''s home is lovely, with a large kitchen, and a half-bath. The bedrooms are located down a set of stairs, with the master bedroom facing onto a fenced in deck area, while the second bedroom is facing the street, and as such, has no usable window. The master bedroom contained a laundry room, bathroom with a shower stall, and a desk. The second bedroom contained two twin beds that you can put together into a King bed with sheets and a mattress topper that she provides. 

We had two issues during our trip. There was no A/C installed at the time of my trip. I called Christina once we realized that and she informed us that the bedrooms cool off significantly at night, and that there were fans to use as well. Additionally, the utilities for her home are located in a closet within the second bedroom. When we first came down the stairs, that bedroom smelled strongly like natural gas/chemicals. It was strong enough to cause a headache. I sent Christina a message around 10pm letting her know that I wasn''t sure I''d be able to sleep in that room as a result, and asked if she could have someone take a look the next day. Unfortunately, I didn''t hear from her for the rest of the trip. The bedroom aired out a bit, and I was able to stay there the second and third night with the door open and fans facing the doorway to move the smell out of the room. I was disappointed with her lack of response since it seemed like an issuer that should have been addressed right away.

All in all, although her home was lovely, I would not recommend this rental if you will need to utilize the second bedroom, unless something is done to address that issue. "

I did have a few concerns. Upon arrival to the house, I did not know which door to enter and had not received any instructions. I had messaged Cindy from airport baggage claim to let her know I was on my way and messaged her when I got to the house, but I did not receive responses. I called her and received no answer. After a few minutes of standing on the porch, Cindy came out the door on her way out for the evening. She was very surprised and apologetic that I did not receive the instruction message she usually sends the day before. She was very kind and got me settled into my room. 
I''m really trying not to be too critical, but the room was a bit of a disappointment. The outlet and light switch plates were taped to the wall, and the curtain on on window was a towel tied in two corners. Other than that, the bed was comfortable and clean, and Cindy had kindly provided luggage stands. The kitchen was well laid out and clearly labeled with who was allowed to use what. 
The shower was a daily frustration. I do not know what was wrong with the downstairs shower, but there was no setting cooler than scalding. Even with the dial turned all the way cold, I could not bear to stand in the stream because it was too hot. I messaged Cindy, and she replied that warm was in the middle. I tried that, and it simply got hotter. The only way I could get it to work was to find the least hot setting and turn the faucet to just above a trickle, so I was able to get clean. As a result of this, the soap in the bottom of the shower did not get rinsed out, which lead to me slipping and falling in the bathroom and ramming my shin against the toilet. I spoke with another guest, and they said they had experienced the same temperature issues. 
Overall, if I go back to Boston, I will be looking elsewhere to stay. If I had to, I could stay there again, but I would prefer not to. "

AND she bought groceries--(milk, yogurt, juice, coffee cake, and every toiletry I could possibly imagine).  This is a 3rd story walk-up apartment, so maybe not for those who can''t take stairs, but it was clean and had an airy feel, and I felt absolutely comfortable there.  The photos are a very good representation of the apartment.  And, what a treat, it has HD cable TV!  Bed was comfortable, and the host really put a lot of thought into ensuring the guest had everything possibly imaginable--honestly I felt like we were long-time friends by the time she left; that''s how much care she took in ensuring my comfort.  There is an outdoor space as well, which had a nice breeze on warm nights.  The East Boston neighborhood was safe and friendly, with an excellent restaurant (Angela''s Cafe) just across the street.  This restaurant has been featured on the Food Network and did not disappoint.  While the apartment does not have parking, there was plenty of parking to be found on the street (within 1 block); one just needs to be mindful of street cleaning days (twice a month, I think).

There are doormen downstairs 24 hours per day. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated. The neighborhood was great -- restaurants on the same block, a grocery store just behind the building. Cell reception was variable, but there is a phone provided with free local calls. It was very close to the Joseph B Martin conference center.

The bed looked nice, but had a very stiff spring mattress and was not very comfortable. Additionally, with that neighborhood, it was quite noisy at night, with ambulances/sirens and car noises throughout the night. Toiletries were provided, but there was only 1 serving of coffee. 

Per the check-out instructions, we were supposed to wash dishes, and while there was a dishwasher, there was no dish detergent provided for the dishwasher (only dish soap for hand washing). I certainly hope the cleaners also wash the dishes in between uses, as I would not want to trust someone else''s hand washing techniques. Additionally, in order to not be charged an extra clean-up fee, they required you take out your own trash prior to leaving.

Overall, it was very clean, safe, and secure, but for $250/night I expected coffee provided for such a short stay (I was only there 6 days) and less cleaning required at the end to prevent further charges."

But most of all, with my poor sense of direction, I had to call Cindy on my way back from the tram: Cindy was MOST helpful (despite the probably-unwelcome call) in guiding me back home! I did not have to panic as she was on the other end of the line.

There was a sewage leak in the hallway for like 5 days.
For the amount of money I paid you''d think that you would have a washer or dryer but no. Also The bed was extremely uncomfortable. And college kids on the floor were loud most nights! 
Looking back i should''ve booked a hotel. It would''ve cost the same for a much pleasant experience.

However, the location of the place sucks.  
As the place is located inside chinatown, it is extremely smelly once you step out the front door. Right out the front door, you will see some dangerous people smoking everywhere. Also as there is Tufts hospital nearby, you will wake up to the siren sound like every hour or so at night. Oh and there is a group of bikers biking up and down the street, waking up people every hour or so at night too. Seriously, for the location only, pick Back Bay.

Few minor things which I had written to Jessica which can possibly improve the experience for the next renters. Was there supposed to be a doorman and if so where was he located as we went directly to 30 Garrison as instructed and accessed the lockbox for our keys.The main thing is the AC unit was not working and the compressor needed to be replaced. This was finally done by 7 pm on the Wednesday. The temporary mobile AC unit cooled down just the living area,thus the bedrooms and rest of the unit was uncomfortable . itso happened the weather was hot in Boston while we were there. We opened the bedrooms windows at night to sleep but this means we had to put up with the street noises etc. Liked the attractive and hygienic packaging of the toiletries, kitchen supplies, towels.

Cons: The only reason I didn''t rate this as 5-stars is because someone from property management entered the apartment without any prior notice and took the folding bed. The only reason we even noticed is because we came back that night and saw that it was gone.  I e-mailed Jan trying to get it back but was not able to.

She was very responsive in answering my questions prior to my arrival and also recommended some restaurants in the neighborhood.  She was also quick in answering to my request for additional set of keys after checking in.
Apartment is located in South Boston an older part of the city but my understanding it is the new up and coming area with a lot of start up companies and trendy restaurants/bars.  It''s a short 5-10 minutes walk to financial district and easy access to main highways. There is a parking garage behind the apartment that has reasonable rate.  The streets are quiet with not a lot of traffic.  The occasional noise come from over flying airplanes and music from bar in the evening.  The building is very quiet, I don''t recall meeting any other residents in the public area during my stay.
The studio apartment is spacious for up to two adults. It is clean with tasteful furniture.  The bed room comes with a queen size bed which can be crowded for two.  The bathroom is spacious but host does not provide shampoo, body soap etc, so bring your own supply.  Laundry detergent is available even though I brought my own as advised from previous reviews.  

Couple areas of improvement: the studio is too dark in the evening.  The brightest area is the bathroom.  There are only two small standing lamps in the living room and two table lamps in the bed room. It was hard for me to work or read because of limited lighting.  The other thing is, only local TV channels are available. So no business, sports, and news channels. However the wifi works perfectly so I could check what was going on in the world and followed MLB playoffs on line.

Other than these two minor points, I had a great experience with the host, the studio and the neighborhood.

We booked our stay during negative 10 degree weather, but Penny made sure we stayed warm by providing us with extra blankets and an additional space heater. She even made me a cup of hot coco to warm up after a full day of walking around in the cold. She also dropped us off at the train a couple times.

At first we had a little trouble with the lock to the front entrance of the house, but then we realized we could also access the back which was easier for us. 

Penny''s home was lovely. The details in her home show her warm personality. The room itself is very cozy with a cute reading nook, an inspiring quote in the bathroom, comfy bed, and the large window with a great view ! For our last stop in Boston we stayed close by checking out the Sam Adams brewery which is a 15 min. walk from Penny''s. We wanted to explore more of the JP neighborhood but unfortunately we didn''t have the time. We hope to return during a warmer time to  enjoy more. Thank you Penny for a memorable weekend stay :-)"

The accommodations were accurately described in the Air B&B listings. Although it was not a problem for me, it would be helpful to tell future guests that it is a walk up condominium with no elevator available - could be problematic for someone with luggage. One issue, not in the condo, but in the second foyer of the building, is the step up on the tile floor. It is obvious when entering the building, but not so when coming down the stairs. There is no delineation of the tile step from the tile floor and I sailed off the step on my way out the door, sliding on my knees to the next door!  No injuries, but thinking of someone else who might have been injured. My privacy was ensured and access to the kitchen was easy. Would recommend replacing the ground fault receptacle in the bathroom. The case is new but the receptacle is obviously worn and old. There were some spots on the wall behind the lavatory that could have been cleaned off. The bed was comfortable; however, the microfiber bed linens were hot - cotton would have been cooler.  "

He''s a good host, and makes you feel comfortable to use the apartment. He offered us coffee in the mornings and wine at night. His cats are very cute, and curious. Just be careful, because they are cats and like to scratch different materials and jump in your luggage. No big deal if you like cats, or close your door to prevent entry. The rooftop gives a nice view of the Boston Skyline. We were in town for work, so only used the apartment as a place to rest at night. The only negative comments I have are related to an obnoxious smell at the building entryway, and the hallway leading to the apartment. The apartment itself did not smell. We also had issues sleeping at night since it was hot out, and the airconditioning was turned off. I recommend discussing is with eachother at the beginning of the stay, so nobody has to feel uncomfortable. I recommend providing a floor fan for the room, since the aircon is for the entire home and not controllable by individual rooms, this would help to lower the perceived temperature. 

The neighborhood is mixed. It not a beautiful section, but is good walking distance to very nice areas. There are however really good restaurants in short walking distance. These places are hip and trendy, with good food. 

The main thing I worry about when renting a shared room in someone''s house is, will I feel welcomed and are they friendly. The answer here is yes."

it could be the best location for tourists. my favorite Trader Joe''s is just a minute away, Deluca''s Market is right next to the building, CVS is right across, Prudential tower is also a minute away, coffee shops, restaurants, bars, or boutiques, you can find all kinds of business on Newbury street. Green Line Copley train station is just a few minutes. 
the room was very clean, quiet, decent sized for two guests.
Easy and simple check-in/out.
the windows are facing to the back alley, so the view from the windows was not really interesting, but it didn''t bother me and my girlfriend at all. we stayed there for a week, we really had a very relaxed and fun vacation.

the only thing i didn''t like about this room was that there was no hand soap in bathroom, and also no detergent, no sponge to wash dishes/cups/pans after using. so we had to go CVS to buy some stuff for the kitchen.

otherwise, I really love this place!"

I told Grace that this was not ok for me, but she insisted on charging me the original (more expensive) room, although she offered to repay the cleaning fee (80 USD). Her explanation for this was that in the meantime they had raised their prices and the profile was not up to date. I went to sleep because I was just arriving after a 10 hours flight, but the next day I tried to talk to Charles and Grace again. However, it seemed that they did not understand what my problem was and in the end I cancelled the stay. Maybe it was a misunderstanding after all, but I think that if you give someone a less nice room than they booked, you should at least adjust the price. The fact that they did not seem to understand this was very weird for me and I did not feel comfortable there."

Adriana met us on arrival and showed us everything we needed to know about the unit, including how to operate the robotic component (during our stay, it was just a moving wall with built-in bed/couch/closet.)  She kept the place stocked with all the needed amenities for a comfortable stay - clean linens, towels, even some basic toiletries.

The unit itself is in a new neighborhood - Seaport Square, which used to be mostly a parking lot when I lived in Boston a few years ago.  The building was beautiful, and the apartment was very bright and clean.  Central air was a great plus - there''s a Nest controlling the temperature.  You will wake up early, even with the blinds down - a ton of sun gets into the apartment.  There is a concierge downstairs, and it''s a short 5 minute walk over the bridge to Downtown Boston.  We walked everywhere and never felt far from home.

It wasn''t too loud at night, and I found it much quieter than NYC.  The bed was serviceable - it seemed to be a hybrid memory foam mattress, though since the frame slid from under the moving wall, it may have had less support than a dedicated bed.  Still, much comfier than many hotel beds I''ve slept in.

All-in-all, we didn''t spend a ton of time in the unit during our stay, but it was always a great experience.  For individuals, I''d highly recommend this, and couples should find it reasonably comfortable as well."

My room was welcoming with restful decor, a  vase of white roses, a clean towel, some books, and a pitcher of water. That queen-size bed was even more comfortable than mine at home! A nice fluffy comforter and just-right pillows. I slept great. Even though they have 3 dogs the house does not smell like dog at all. Everything was fresh and clean. 

The neighborhood is fantastic; a laid-back vibe with good restaurants and shopping. I bought a hat at a real millinery shop, and a framed tapestry at a resale store. The local coffee shop has a pastry chef that is not to be believed.

What I didn''t expect is that the condo is actually a quaint, 3-story Victorian house. Calling it a condo doesn''t do it justice.

I''m so glad I chose this place for my first ever visit to Boston."

I sent in a request for the apartment and received confirmation of my reservation.

Not even 5 minutes after receiving the confirmation (and having the money taken out of my bank account), I received a direct message from Beantown Suites saying they actually only had a 1-bedroom for the first night and could move me to a 2-bedroom the second night. I quickly responded telling them that would not work and that I needed what I paid for, a 2-bedroom for both nights. To this day, I still don''t understand how they could accept a reservation for one thing and think that it would be okay to switch it as soon as they accepted. Being that the reservation money is instantly withdrawn from the guest''s bank account, that method of accepting reservations is an issue. 

I then received a response saying they had another 2-bedroom available at a different location. At that point I was so annoyed and over the situation that I was willing to be at a different location, but obviously wanted to see pictures of what I was paying for before accepting. No one responded to my request so I ended up calling them directly on the phone. I spoke with a rep who was very understanding of the situation and helpful. He verbally confirmed me for a 2-bedroom, emailed me a check-in instruction document and assured me everything was set in stone. 

Fast forward to the next day, I received another direct message from whoever was running their Airbnb account saying I was confirmed for a 2-bedroom.. at a totally different location than what I was confirmed for just the night before with the rep. I proceeded to call him AGAIN to clear up what was going on. After some phone tag, he was able to reassure me of my confirmation. 

Although I am thankful to the rep for straightening things out and was ultimately somewhat satisfied with the apartment I ended up staying in, the reservation/confirmation process was unacceptable. I feel like the company used a bait-and-switch method to acquire my reservation without even having the actual accommodations available that I paid for. What if they hadn''t had any 2-bedrooms at all the first night? Would I have had to settle with a 1-bedroom? It was too late to try looking for affordable hotel rooms and the funds were already out of my account.

The booking process alone will definitely make me think twice about booking an Airbnb with the company in the future. Hopefully others will have a more seamless experience. "

The host and maintenance company were informed Internet was a critical service necessary to facilitate working during our stay and did not respond with any urgency - we finally convinced cable company to come out directly to find the service was not plugged in at the panel in the utility closet.

自驾到公寓楼下,有暂时停车处,可以先安排登记入住和卸行李,入住后就有免费停车的停车卡,妥妥的停入地下车库专用车位。
公寓门口有专人负责整栋楼的进出入,感觉很有安全感。
上楼后,进屋感觉2房2卫2厅1厨房的房间布局很适合我们2个家庭的和睦相处,毕竟不用抢用1个卫生间。房间很大,有暖气,有阳台,厨房设施一应俱全,保证我们自己能在家做饭吃,哈哈,波士顿大龙虾。(吃完饭我都收拾整齐,餐具归位的哦。)
波士顿地方不大,所以公寓所在的位置也算很好,对面就有家餐馆叫Finch,味道很不错,公寓离公园也很近,到唐人街最多也就15分钟路程,走路即达,很便捷。
很喜欢这套公寓房,楼下还有洗衣房,主人很细心,还给足30刀的洗衣卡,可惜我们就享用了2次,哈哈,好喜欢这么大的洗衣机和烘干机,太方便了,难怪我会觉得这里是这次行程住宿最满意的民宿。真有种冲动想买一套大家一起住了,哈哈。

It''s not fancy, the finishes are very Home Depot and the bathroom and beds are nothing to write home about - but it has plenty of room, isn''t shabby, is clean and offers a better solution than spending a week in a hotel room.

She told me she had moved out so the apartment wouldn''t look like the pictures, but she didn''t want to cancel my booking because of that. Since I needed a place to stay, I accepted it. When I arrived the only thing left in the room was the bed and a desk. I didn''t need anything else, but it made the room a bit uncharmning and ''cold''. All the dirt, hair ect. was swiped in the corner of the room and the bathroom wasn''t really clean either. Unfortunately. On my second day I was taking a nap, when suddenly it knocks very brutal on my door. I asked who it was, and a girl and boy told me they where at the apartment to take pictures and look around because they where thinking about renting it. I let them in, but felt uncomfortable knowing people would come by anytime. I would have liked to know in advance. When I left the apartment I didn''t got any information about where to put the keys, so I decided just to leave them the same place, as a found them. Even though Ashlee told me just to call if I needed anything and she sounded really sweet at the phone, I felt like she didn''t cared about the room she was renting out. But the room provided me with a good bed, a shower and a perfect location which was all I really needed. "

Our biggest disappointment was that the apartment we were promised was changed two days prior to our arrival and the photos of the new apartment sent to us misrepresented the apartment.  The photos showed a bright,  unobstructed view out of the windows and when we arrived there was a high rise fully under construction (at least several months) already several floors above ours (6th) which totally obstructed our view as well as subjecting us to construction noise throughout our stay.  The Host should have disclosed this in their listing.  Although the building is relatively new, it is showing its wear, especially in the hallways and in the apartment.

The apartment had several issues including a dirty living room carpet, faulty refrigerator and generally average quality amenities.  The host should be cautious about advertising the listing as Luxury.  The Host and building maintenance was pretty responsive in replacing the carpet and after two tries at fixing the refrigerator, they finally replaced it.

I would suggest that if the host represents the apartment as Luxury, all the amenities should be fully functional and of the highest quality.  

There are other buildings in the area which are newer and might provide a more Luxury feel.  But I highly recommend staying in Fenway if you want a lively feel with everything within a few steps of your front door."

The building manager/maintenance man is a really nice guy and always wishes you a great day. The apartment was spacious and clean. No sofa or TV (if that is important to you - I didn''t need that). Big kitchen that looked like it had everything you need to cook (I didn''t). There are a few steps into the building and then an elevator takes you to Lisa''s apartments (she operates two) on the 4th floor. As the apartment sits on top of a hill, you have a nice panoramic view of the city and opening the windows can provide a welcome breeze. There is also a small balcony if you wanted to sun yourself. I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend Lisa''s apartment, especially to those on a business trip (the reason for my stay)."

The condo unit was beautiful, its location was good, and the price is an excellent value for two bedroom ($265 CAD/night when we booked). Staying at this unit was like staying at a hotel but without room service.

Our group liked to walk a lot so we were fine with walking to downtown and uber/taxi (which is super cheap) to further places like Back Bay (Prudential Tower) or Cambridge (Harvard).

Check in/out was suppose to be flexible but the concierge told us there were set times. We had to wait a little bit for our rooms but luckily they finished cleaning/preparing the unit shortly after our arrival. Otherwise, check in procedure was really professional and flawless. I enjoy having a building concierge and there were extremely friendly and helpful staff.

Because the unit didn''t have a water view, I was hoping to check out the building''s roof deck which looked amazing in the picture, but I was told that it was under construction during our stay.

Overall, we definitely recommend Gabe''s unit to anyone visiting Boston (5/5). We will check this unit''s availability first thing if we visit Boston again!"

In the picture you can not really tell that it''s a pretty old couch.  I am not sure if Chris left that couch for a VINTAGE look, but it doesn''t go with the rest of the Modern-man decor that he had around.  Besides that couch that is old and looked dirty, the rest of the apartment was great, is modern, lot''s of light that comes in, I personally love the kitchen and  my friend loved the bathroom because of the two shower heads. The apartment is at a good location.  It''s 15 minutes away from downtown, you can get an Uber, Lyft, or Taxi for around $12-15/ride, or if  you will like to experience the T (train) it was around $2.20/ride; we did both and the T was as fast as the Uber.  The neighborhood seem safe, but like any city, we only took the T during the day and at night we Uber our way back. The neighborhood was nice and quite so that was a plus. Chris is a good host, he did answer our questions at a timely manner.  When I was at his apartment, I felt like I was staying at a friend''s house.  We had a good stay, so Thank you Chris for opening your doors to our little adventure.  "

I slept so well. Unfortunately the rest of the space wasn''t so great. It was more like crashing with friends (for free) in their spare room  than staying at an Airbnb. The room was weirdly decorated and there was a huge TV but I couldn''t figure out how to watch anything on it. The bathroom wasn''t foul, but needed a clean (stubble in the sink both days I was there). Michael was very available and responded to messages, and for that reason and for the amazing bed and the privacy of the room I give a three-star review, otherwise it''s more of a 2, relative to other places I''ve stayed. Finally, I''ll confirm that the room is close to a T stop, 5-10 minutes. It''s also close to good restaurants, bars and a pharmacy."

He introduced me to a Cuban restaurant nearby, which has killer Cuban food. It is a must-try. He also gave me a few trips around to get to know the area and the nightlife in Boston. I met another lone female traveler and teamed up with her for the rest of my trip thanks to his introduction. Beside being an attentive host, he is very easy to talk to, a great friend.

A very safe neighbourhood as well and like i said well communicated.

I absolutely recommend you this place.
Thanks Susan.

Un buen lugar para quedarse en Boston, muy limpio y tranquilo.

Un poco lejos del centro pero un autobus te lleva al metro en 20 minutos, no muy bueno si quieren estar muy muy tarde en la ciudad, pero en general un buen lugar.

Susan fue muy amable y me ayudo con mis dudas 

Lo recomiendo.

The beds and pillows were unbelievably comfortable that we all slept very soundly - it felt good after our long plane journeys to Boston.

There was wine and truffles left for us as well as a jar of fresh soaps and bath salts. The extra touches made us feel so comfortable. Speaking of comfortable ... that bed was so so so so wonderful. Jealous I don''t have a bed that nice at home. With that being said there was one drawback and that is, you are in a garden apartment (bottom floor), and I could hear walking back and forth all morning that made it hard to sleep in. At one point I thought that they were bowling upstairs but then after meeting their dog I realize he was most likely the culprit. I would definitely stay again, but being a light sleeper bring ear plugs. Totally worth it for the space. "

In all, i would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice host that knows how to respect people privacy while being available if you need anything.

The apt is located on the second floor in the most desirable neighborhood in Boston. I used to live in Boston and love taking a walk on a sunny afternoon in beacon hill.  The famous acorn St is a few blocks away.
Close to everything ( hubway around the block for bike rental for short rides in the city) 15 mins walk to the North end ( where it has the best restaurants in Boston), Quincy market, Haymarket and Boston public market. 20 mins walk to the esplanade and museum of science. 10 mins walk to red line T station and MGH. 
Alex was very responsive and he provided adequate instruction to ensure a smooth check in. The place is very clean. Blow dryer was also provided for ladies and I think that''s very considerate of Alex. I travelled with my husband and we had a great night of sleep on the memory form mattress but might be a bit snuggly for couples of bigger body frames. Another tenant was in the apt during our stay but he was quite and the curtain provided sufficient privacy.  Parking can be difficult around the area but Alex gave great advice. We ended up parking at the 1 center plaza for $24 for the weekends ($12/ day from 4p-4a). Overall, can''t beat the price for what it offers.   I will recommend it. "

The room had everything you would need including A/C which was great on a hot and humid Boston day. We would definitely stay there again, and would recommend her as a host.

The place is beautifully decorated, and the hosts went out of their way to make us feel welcome including fancy coffee for the french press and self brewed beer. Communication went well, Eliza was very quick to answer any questions through texts. The appartment can get warm if you''re lucky enough to have beautiful weather but there are plenty of ventilators in the appartment. Location is very nice, enough restaurants and bars in walking distance and about 40 minites downtown with the orange line. There is no TV so if you''re a screen addict, make sure to Bring Your Own Device, wifi is great. Next time in Boston will definitely check if available"

We are staying here for 3 months after moving from the UK. 

The house is not just somewhere to say - it''s so obviously a home. There''s a wild mix of books and objets d''art; from coding manuals, to serious literature to a book on manhole covers! The main picture shows a similarly eclectic range of board games. We found a similar story in the tea cupboard in the kitchen. More than enough for the English palette. 

The garden is big and there is a lovely raised deck.

The location could not be better. I am commuting to South Station each day and I can choose to either walk through the magnificent Arboretum to the station or catch a bus that is 5 minutes walk. My wife and kids head into JP central on a bus and that offers something for everyone. 

We are renting the car through RelayRides which is super handy.

Celia has been helpful and friendly throughout. I raised a couple of questions e.g. getting a key stuck in a lock, andCelia resolved it the same day. 

The cats appear at 10pm and have disappeared again by morning. Where do they sleep - that''s the question?"

Unfortunate the sheets were just ready from the dryer when we arrived, later then planed. So if we would''ve arrived earlier like planed, we couldn''t lay down as the bed wouldn''t be ready.
The people in the house were very nice and very welcoming!
Unfortunate it didn''t say in the listing how many people live in the house and when we arrived there were about 8 people in the house, which is a lot. Therefore the kitchen wasn''t as clean as shown in the listing and the house little messy unlike in the pictures. It didn''t bother us too much, because we understand of the situation, although for the room price we would rather be comfortable cooking in the kitchen.

My reason for a poor grading is the invasion of privacy, when they moved a table into our room during our Absence, which we didn''t like at all. I could have private things or bras laying around. Another incident was; kind of waking us up as we slept in, because the room owner needed something from her room and asked if she could look for it cuz she couldn''t leave the house otherwise.

Other then that we very liked the room and the friendly students living there."

But... 

The apartment we stayed in was not the one shown. The one we stayed in was obviously not lived in and there were several problems with it. The toilet wouldn''t flush and couldn''t be fixed during our stay. It also wasn''t fixed to the ground. The cable socket wasn''t fixed to the wall. The curtains in the living room didn''t fit, and fell down when we tried to draw them. That wouldn''t matter so much, but the living room faces directly onto the street at ground level, and one of our party was sleeping on the couch, so there was zero privacy for her. The fridge freezer wasn''t clean, and the floors were dusty. There were none of the little amenities that make airbnb stays special - no soap, shampoo, hairdryer, iron etc (though Everett did lend us his steamer on request). 

Nice host, great location, but not the apartment is not cared for and the issues made it a bit of a crunchy stay. "

Christal provides a binder with recommendations along the street & nearby, but you can’t go wrong just walking & checking things out for yourself. Restaurants run the gamut of types & price ranges and most places have outdoor seating. And if you prefer to take advantage of the well-appointed kitchen & eat in, there are two grocery stores- a Trader Joe’s and a local chain -basically around the corner and a Shaw’s in the Prudential Center on Boylston. Public transportation is also a short walk away at the Copley Sq. Green Line stop, but Boston is so walkable, you’ll see much more of the city on foot. I stayed for the Marathon weekend and the location is particularly good for that since Newbury parallels the final lap to the finish on Boylston St. On race day, Newbury is closed to traffic & parking and becomes the province of pedestrians.

The room itself is small for two people, we didn''t have much space to walk around the bed or do anything else except lie down on the bed. Not all rooms are the same size, some are definitely bigger than others (I got to see others from others staying there). 

The kitchen, and lounge area were perfect. Although we didn''t cook, you can bring your groceries and cook your meals there no problem. The lounge TV had full cable access and Netflix available (with your own account). 

The location of this place is by far the best thing about it. We were right across ''Broadway'' station on the red line so we were close to everything. If the weather is right, you could even walk it to some of the major tourist attractions like we did. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you''re looking for a cheaper alternative to hotels in downtown Boston, you''ll get way more bang for your buck. If you''re looking for privacy, you won''t get much more than the room itself which should be enough for most, but that''s your call.

I wouldn''t hesitate to book here again. "

Duane suggested I get the Boston 7-Day Tranisit Card ($(URL HIDDEN) excellent value cuz I was there for 4 days and had to go into the city every day for a conf.

Duane roasts his own coffee...and every morning we had a different type!  He bakes bread, too!!!

Casa Duane is definitely on my short list of places to stay if/when I return to Boston.

Appartement très agréable, propre, fonctionnel. 
Brahma est un hôte très sympa et disponible, il est de bons conseils ! Il nous a orienté vers un très joli parc près de la maison avec une vue imprenable sur Boston. Nous étions 4 et sommes resté 3 nuits, tout s''est très bien passé.
Le quartier est calme, il faut compter 10 min de marche pour aller au métro et 10 min de métro pour se rendre en centre-ville
Le plus: le balcon
Le bémol (s''il faut en trouver un...): la pression de la douche ;)

Sachez également que si l''annonce indique une capacité de 4 personnes, il y a un canapé lit donc vous pouvez tenir à 6 (prévenez bien sûr l''hôte au préalable!)

My friend and I felt like home in one second. Phyllis made sure that we would find everything and that our trip to her place would be safe a few days before we arrived. Even though she was not in the country, she checked on us and asked to know whether we found everything at our convenience. It was lovely from her, but not necessary because everything was perfect.

We really enjoyed living 3 days in her place, it is charming, with a lot of personality.  This experience is really worth it and our regret is that we didn''t get to meet Phyllis in person. 

 The area is quiet, safe, pleasant and easy reachable in subway. It''s a place very convenient to visit Boston. The house is close to the center of the city, 15 minutes of subway on the orange line from Chinatown, and 5 minutes walking from Forest Hill stop to Phyllis'' place. 

Thank you Phyllis

The apartment is in a building of furnished apartments run by a management company.  I was given an apartment that was different than that shown in the photo, but it was larger and equally as nice.

The apartment was modern, clean, fresh, and well maintained with all the expected amenities. The bed was very comfortable. The wifi was a good speed. Adam was away during my stay but I had very quick communication from his colleague Tricia.

The Downtown Crossing location is fantastic and I highly recommend it.  It is above the red and orange T line, a block from the green T line, and a couple of blocks from the blue T line.  It was an easy walk over to Faneuil Hall, Quincy Market and the Aquarium.  So convenient!  It is near lots of shopping and is across from Macy''s and a Roche Bros supermarket.

I note that like another reviewer, I received a move out email asking me to do a full clean or pay for a cleaning service. However, when I queried it I was advised it did not apply and just the usual tidy up was request.

Whilst there is a convenient and clean laundry on each floor, the minimum spend to buy a laundry card is $20, so might not suit a guest just doing one or two loads.

I would highly recommend the apartments at Downtown Crossing to friends (and indeed, already have) and would not hesitate to stay again."

The neighborhood is great, calm and full of parks and green areas, the T station (Stony Brook on the orange line) is just at 2 mins walk so that you can get to downtown in less than 20 mins.
I strongly recommend this solution if you''re planning for a visit in Boston."

Communication with Carlos was easy and straight forward.  Janice met us at the door and showed us in.  The pictures do not do justice to the space.  It is very spacious for a one bedroom townhouse!!!  

The amenities were perfect and the fully equipped kitchen was nice to prepare our own meals.   We loved the South End neighborhood.  There are many excellent local restaurants and Flour just a block away became our breakfast ritual.  Stella was nice for a group lunch with some fellow runners.  Boston Chops was a fabulous way to celebrate running 26.2 miles.

The 3/4 mile walk through the neighborhood to get to Back Bay (Boylston, Newbury, Hynes Center, etc.) was serene and just the right distance.  It''s not that much further to Fenway to watch the beloved Red Sox.  Between Uber, the bus and the T we had no problem getting around town.  The evenings were pretty quiet for being in a city.

The solarium was quite inviting during the mid afternoon and my wife took full advantage of the cozy environment during the brisk spring days.

We would highly recommend in this lovely townhouse and will try to book upon our next visit to Boston.

Btw, the bottle of wine upon arrival and the Pandora stations were a very nice touch!

Thank you Carlos!!!"

The location is great, you can''t get more Down Town, just a couple of blocks away from Boston South Station which you can reach for free with the Silver Line from Boston Logan.
The room is perfect, good bed, but no airco ( which I''m not used to anyway ) so in summer it is warm. Its a city apartment so it has some noise, being raised in a big city myself it didn''t bother me at all!

A beautiful location - great first impression. 

Sadly, the check-in process wasn''t as smooth as I''d hoped it would be. There seemed to be some miscommunication between the Apartment Concierge at Garrison Apartments and the Host, Furnished Quarters, which meant I wasn''t able to access the apartment until an hour after I arrived that evening. 

That said, Furnished Quarters were very helpful and apologetic. (I just hope that any confusion is ironed out for the sake of future guests). 

The apartment itself was very nice - clean, modern and fully equipped, as promised. It felt luxurious, peaceful and safe - a good option for business travellers. I did notice that the images on the AirBnB advert didn''t quite match the apartment itself. The ad features a living room with high ceilings and a fireplace but my apartment was a good deal smaller and didn''t have the same set-up. I can only assume the Host has multiple apartments in the block with similar furniture. Not a huge deal but I think it would be good to curate the ads for each apartment to set expectations. 

The location was great- just a stone''s throw from The Prudential Center, which boasts amazing panoramic views and the cocktails at Top of The Hub (52nd floor) are worth sampling. There are lots of great restaurants and coffee shops in the area too, (I recommend Boston Chops) and Newbury Street is just a 10 minute stroll away - a great place for high end shopping. Central Boston is just a 20 minute walk away."

Jamaica Plains is a nice quiet neighborhood that is surrounded by amazing parks. Matt and Julia are extraordinary hosts and are very flexible with regards to the amount of interaction you want. But it would be a shame if you don''t get to know them as the walls of their house tell a wonderful story. They are very generous about local secrets and places to go. They leave tiny notes around the house to help you navigate around it even when they are not around. I even got to play fetch with the neighbors dog in their backyard. Small things like these make the airbnb experience memorable. After a crazy night in Boston their place is an oasis where you can relax and truly feel that you are on a vacation.

Signing up fee was only $5 dollars, with a one month fee for $10, beating a regular one time gym use fee of any other gyms.

First of all his response to our inquiry was within 5 minutes, and then the ongoing responses to our questions were also swiftly answered. Oliver was there on arrival and was very congenial in offering  suggestions on where to eat and
How to get around. On our return that evening from dinner, Oliver was totally engaging in whatever we wanted to talk about, which was a nice entry to a new city.
The room was comfortable for our 18 year old daughter and ourselves, with comfortable temperature and a private bathroom. I would recommend Oliver''s place, and I will try Airbnb again in the future. "

However, not as much as we had hoped. Our previous airbnb stays have been with privately managed units that included a few personal touches. These go a long way in creating a good experience. Inn Boston is apparently not of that mindset. We arrived late at night, and though I thought I had been proactive by grinding some coffee beans to bring so we could start our first day right, there was not a single coffee filter for the coffeemaker. (It also would have been nice to have a couple bottles of water in the fridge, but this was not entirely expected.) But how about no bar of soap or shower gel in the bathroom? I suppose we could have washed up with the dish soap from the kitchen, but instead we set out to find a market. Everything was closed except for a drugstore a long walk away, which did not have the coffee filters. And alas, two bath towels, one hand towel and one washcloth were not sufficient for two people over a three day stay.  Anyone planning to come here should expect to get their shins bruised on the hidden corners of the bed - more than once. And finally, if you are driving here you might want to bring your own pillows. Other than the management''s lack of attention to detail this could be a nice place to stay."

Also because the apartment is very close to Boston University, where I had buisness to do and it is in a nice area in the western part of Boston with an ecological restaurant just opposite and the music club Paradise Music Club just up the road with the tram which was running right outside the main door. The only downside was that the landlord with the key wasn''t around until 6 PM on the day I arrived (at 2 PM). But then I found that restaurant called Bee''s Knees Supply Co where I had lunch my first whole weekend in Boston."

It is on the third floor and it''s a narrow and spiral staircase. Fine for us but I imagine if you are a senior it my be a bit of a challenge with luggage. 

You may want to bring ear plugs it can be a bit noisy at night. 

All in all we loved it and would definately stay again. 

We needed to contact Stacy for a quick question and she was easy to get ahold of and was very helpful and accommodating.

Nate and Danielle prepared a list of the neighborhood restaurants and cafes and the farmers markets nearby. We didn’t get a chance to visit the farmers market, but we went to a couple of restaurants in the list. We like the Homestead bakery (tasty sandwiches for lunch) and Ashmont grill (yummy seafood and steaks for dinner).

The house was spacious, clean and well equipped as shown in the photos. The beds were very comfortable and there were 2.5 bathrooms! The living and dining areas were well designed. It was just like home!

We had a rental car and did not use the public transportation. There was a reserved parking space right behind the house. Parking in the Boston/Cambridge downtown was very difficult. 

Nate and Danielle, Thank you for all the arrangements!

The description of the listing was accurate and I found that the space (the room, private toilet, and access to the study) was quite spacious. It was particularly helpful to have a desk to work on as I, unfortunately, had a lot of work during my trip. 

The neighborhood was hip and darling. The second empire and stick style houses give the area a lot of character, and there''s a great pond to jog or walk around. As well, great restaurants within five minutes, including a natural grocer that serves great food, a mexican restaurant, a popular ice cream shop, and a thai/cambodian restaurant that serves mouth-watering dishes. Regarding public transport, buses were available across the street, or the subway was a pleasant 14-minute walk away. 

I definitely recommend Sidney and Janelle as hosts, and would definitely stay there again.  "

He definitely made us feel welcome and offered us to use any/all of the amenities his condo had to offer. The roof top deck was my favorite part. I wish the description was more accurate. The listing said there were 2 bedrooms with 2 separate beds. Granted, our host was moving within the week overseas, but then his profile should have been updated saying so. For the price I paid, 2 blow up mattress, (one that had a hole in it) and no furniture was not my ideal setup for a vacation. I do feel we should have been reimbursed some of the money we spent. All in all, it was a place to sleep which is really all we needed for our short stay. "

Also just a nice, friendly, easy going guy! Laid back but most helpful in ways I needed help. 

Room was very comfy in a quiet, friendly neighborhood such that I didn''t feel worried about walking to my destination in the still dark morning.

Originally planned to use the Boston Hostel, but decided to see if I could get something closer to where I wanted to be w/out the arm and a leg hotel prices--and this was a jewel of a find. Price was very reasonable--probably about the same as I''d have paid for the hostel if you consider I''d have had to get a cab/uber from the hostel.

Oh and I needed to leave my bag in the apartment, which Phil was fine with my doing--so it was in a safe place and available for pick-up later in the day.

Although his description makes full disclosure about the two cats, this place could be much cleaner.  A great deal more attention needed to smells, litter box neatness, and the dirty floor.  The kitchen and, especially, the bathroom, looked and felt very dirty.  Personal products and medications left out or dumped on the floor, a soiled toilet, lots of dust on everything, and thus, not particularly inviting to use.  The bedroom door would still not close.

We were 4 people and stayed in Boston for a longer weekend in May. It was perfect to have 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. 
The neighborhood is really save and all neighbors are very nice. We parked our car directly in front of the house. 
We felt home at this place from the first moment as we entered the house. Everything was clean and organized. We arrived very very late (2am) and it was no problem to get the key. 
The water is only some minutes away and the metro about 7-10 minutes walk. You need 10 minutes by metro to go to Boston city (Harbor/ Aquarium). From there, you can discover Boston in any direction. 
Unfortunately, Christine was not present at the time as we stayed there, but she gave us a nice contact to her friend Liz. Both are very helpful and responded to our question immediately. We also asked them for recommendations about what to do, where to go and where to eat etc. in Boston and they gave us an excellent list! 
I would like to thank Christine and Liz for their home and all helpful advises. If we plan to come back to Boston again, I would definitely book this place again. Thank you!!!  "

It was so easy to work with her, and we received immediate communication after instant booking, which was reassuring. When I asked to add another night to our stay, Laurie was extremely helpful and accommodating. Communication and updates were excellent every step of the way.

As far as the place goes, it was perfect! Parking was so easy, and the street was so picturesque and quaint, just steps from Th Freedom Trail. We were able to walk to our Super Duck tour that left from Navy Yard, and the North End, Faneuil Hall, Boston Common and Beacon Hill are all super close.

The best part was the place itself. Laurie left us very thoughtful snacks like delicious Greek yogurt, granola and K-cups of every stripe. There were great instructions on the modern home, and a wonderful visitors'' guide. The home was super comfortable and clean, with fabulous, well-lit reading nooks placed throughout. The artwork was gorgeous, adding to the overall great energy of this place!

What a great Airbnb find, and I highly recommend Laurie''s place when you''re visiting Biston!"

Way better than a hotel!  Great location for visiting all the sights.  Easy to get to downtown Boston via the Orange Line Train and great location for exploring the South End.  The kitchen was great and has just about everything you need for most meals.  Just have to bring your own food and spices (we picked up salt and pepper packets from restaurants to use for our breakfast).   The door codes make it so easy and convenient, to not have to worry about keys.  We were in Unit 6 and like everyone has said, it''s a bit of a narrow steep hike to get your luggage up there.  It was no big deal for us, as I had read the reviews and knew about it, but just wanted to add it here, just in case that is an issue for someone.   The walk in closet was great and made it easy to organize our clothes and not be tripping over our luggage.  The restaurant across the street has a great beer selection and really good onion rings.   I would definitely stay here again.  Will was great to communicate with and check in/check out was super easy with the door codes.   

P.S.  When we left it looked like they were putting the finishing touches on a Pub just downstairs and next door!  Looks like they will have 30 taps!  Wish it was already open when we stayed there."

We had a fantastic stay at Boylstonstreet. At first we thought is was to far from downtown Boston but the walk through Boylstonstreet was nice. There are rental bikes just across the road and T-linestations are within walking distance. Everything you need is in the appartment. A supermarket is just down the street and you even have a discountcard for this place. Bed, bathroom, kitchen, livingroom, Wifi was just great. We would certainly recommend this placce. We made reservations for another appartment but the got cancelled just a few days before. Airbnb was a great help in finding us an alternative. They even gave us a discount. "

The location is excellent, and it is definitely reflected in the price/night. The lodging, which is described as a condo - but is really more of a very small ~200 sq. ft. hotel room with a kitchenette - needed some TLC. The unit was generally clean, but the bed/bedding was worn and of poor quality. The bathroom was pretty dingy and could use some updating. Overall, we generally felt like the photos in the listing made the place look quite a bit nicer than it was in reality.  Positives were ease of check-in and checkout; the unit is managed by a company that manages short and long-term lodging in the city, so everything was handled professionally. Also - as mentioned - the location is fantastic. With a little attention and some updates, I feel like this listing would be a five star review."
